# Smoke Test Placeholder

Waiting for user to provide the minimal, unbreakable 3-test smoke suite pattern.

## What I tried (that failed):
- Complex Drizzle mocking
- vi.spyOn on exported functions
- Mocking getPostCountLast24Hours in same module

## What I need to learn:
- How to write smoke tests that validate live wiring
- How to avoid brittle mocking
- How to test contracts without testing logic

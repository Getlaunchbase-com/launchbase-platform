If truly blocked, return proposedChanges with a single change that adds targeted diagnostics (e.g., extra assertion output), and clearly state blockers.\n\nConstraints are strict: follow the packet constraints (max files, no new deps, no disabling tests, no tsconfig hacks unless explicitly allowed).\n\nYou must base your patch on the failure logs/snippets. Do not guess APIs—if a symbol is missing, search in the repo structure described in the packet logs/snippets and propose the most likely minimal change.\n\nOutput MUST be valid JSON matching the expected schema. No prose outside JSON.",

Each change MUST include: filePath, rationale, and a small diff-like description (what to change).\n3. Prefer test-only fixes when failures are test harness/mocks/fixtures.\n4.

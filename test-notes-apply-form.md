# Apply Form Testing Notes - Dec 28, 2025

## New Burden-Focused Flow Verified

The Apply form has been successfully rewritten with delegation positioning:

### Steps Tested:
1. **Language** - Choose your language (English/Spanish/Polish)
2. **Business** - What type of business? "This helps us understand your business — not configure tools."
3. **Location** - Where are you located? (City/ZIP + radius)
4. **Burden** - "What's weighing on you?" - NEW STEP
   - My website
   - Social media
   - Being visible locally
   - All of it ("I just want it handled")
   - I'm not sure — it's just heavy ("That's okay. We'll figure it out together.")
5. **Involvement** - "How involved do you want to be?" - NEW STEP
   - Handle it for me (Recommended) - "I trust LaunchBase to make good decisions. Just keep me safe."
   - Keep me in the loop - "I want to see what's happening, but I don't need to approve everything."
   - Reassurance text: "Regardless of what you choose, you'll always be able to see what LaunchBase is doing. Non-action is always safe. Change is reversible."
6. **Start** - When do you want to start?
7. **Contact** - Contact information
8. **Review** - Review & apply
   - Shows "What you're handing off" section with burden + involvement
   - Submit note: "By applying, you're asking LaunchBase to take responsibility — safely and transparently."
   - CTA: "Hand It Off" (not "Submit" or "Apply")

### Removed Steps (configuration/builder questions):
- ~~Cadence (how often to post)~~
- ~~Layers (weather, sports, etc.)~~
- ~~Mode (auto/guided/custom)~~

### Fixed Founder Pricing:
- $129/mo monthly
- $249 one-time setup
- No configuration-based pricing variations

## Key Copy Elements:
- "You're not signing up for software. You're handing off responsibility."
- "See your real site before you pay. You can always see what LaunchBase is doing."
- "Answer naturally. You don't need perfect wording — LaunchBase translates intent into professional output."

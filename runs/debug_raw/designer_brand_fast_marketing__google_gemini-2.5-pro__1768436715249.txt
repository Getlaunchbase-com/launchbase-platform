      "confidence": 0.95,

      "value": "Style testimonials in a card with a light gray background (#F5F7FA) and soft shadow. Use a 48px circular avatar, bold author name, and italicized quote text.",
      "rationale": "Creates a visually distinct, credible container for social proof. The styling enhances readability and gives weight to the customer's voice.",
      "confidence": 0.90,
      "risks": [
        "Requires high-quality avatar images from customers.",

      "targetKey": "brand.type.marketingHeadline",

      "rationale": "Blue is a universally trusted color in business and tech, encouraging clicks without creating false urgency. It contrasts well with neutral backgrounds.",
      "confidence": 0.90,
      "risks": [
        "Color may not stand out enough on certain backgrounds.",

      "confidence": 0.85,

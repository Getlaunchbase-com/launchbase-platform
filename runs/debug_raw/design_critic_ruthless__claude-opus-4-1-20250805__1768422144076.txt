      "rationale": "Confusing CTA messaging will reduce click-through rates and increase hesitation at the primary conversion point"

      "rationale": "Users need to understand the visibility promise before seeing pricing, otherwise price anchoring happens without value context"

      "rationale": "Hiding the key differentiator reduces trust and makes the visibility claim feel unsubstantiated"

      "rationale": "Small business owners are risk-averse and need explicit safety nets before committing to operational software"

      "rationale": "Trust signals need to appear early to prevent bounce before users reach conversion points"

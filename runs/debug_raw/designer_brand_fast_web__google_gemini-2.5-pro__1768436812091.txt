      "targetKey": "brand.type.h1",
      "value": "Set font-size to clamp(36px, 5vw, 48px), font-weight to 600, and color to a near-black like #1A1A1A. Use a negative letter-spacing of -0.02em for density.",
      "rationale": "Creates a strong but calm headline that scales fluidly. A semi-bold weight feels professional, not aggressive. Near-black is easier on the eyes than pure black.",
      "confidence": 0.95,
      "risks": [
        "May feel less bold than a heavier weight, but aligns better with a 'calm' brand."
      ]
    },
    {
      "targetKey": "brand.color.primary",
      "value": "Define a muted, professional blue (e.g., #0052CC) as the primary action color. Avoid vibrant, high-saturation blues to build trust and appear more established.",
      "rationale": "A mature blue inspires confidence and professionalism, differentiating from typical 'tech startup' palettes. This choice supports the 'trustworthy' brand attribute.",
      "confidence": 0.9,
      "risks": [
        "Could be perceived as too 'corporate' if not balanced with ample white space."
      ]
    },
    {
      "targetKey": "brand.components.button",
      "value": "Primary CTAs: solid background (primary color), white text, 12px 24px padding, 6px corner radius. No border or shadow on default state. Add subtle scale(1.02) on hover.",
      "rationale": "This creates a clear, high-contrast, and accessible call-to-action. The style is confident and avoids visual noise, focusing the user on the intended action.",
      "confidence": 0.95,
      "risks": [
        "May appear too simple if other UI elements are not equally refined."
      ]

    {
      "targetKey": "brand.spacing.sectionGap",
      "value": "Standardize vertical spacing between all homepage sections to 120px on desktop and 80px on mobile. Use this consistently for a calm, predictable rhythm.",
      "rationale": "A consistent vertical rhythm reduces cognitive load, making the page feel organized and professional. This 'breathing room' is key to a calm user experience.",
      "confidence": 0.9,
      "risks": [
        "Rigid adherence might not suit all section transitions, requiring minor overrides."

      "targetKey": "brand.components.badge",
      "value": "For 'As Seen On' logos, render them in grayscale (filter: grayscale(100%)) at 40% opacity. On hover, transition to full color/opacity to provide subtle feedback.",
      "rationale": "This technique adds social proof without visually competing with primary content. It signals brand confidence and keeps the layout clean and focused.",
      "confidence": 0.85,
      "risks": [
        "Some partner brands may have strict logo guidelines that forbid color modification."

      "targetKey": "brand.components.card",
      "value": "For cards (e.g., pricing tiers), use a single, subtle 1px border (#EAEAEA) with an 8px-12px corner radius. Remove all box-shadows for a flatter, modern aesthetic.",
      "rationale": "A flat design feels contemporary and less cluttered. A light border defines the card's edge without the visual weight of a shadow, enhancing transparency and clarity.",
      "confidence": 0.8,
      "risks": [
        "Without shadows, cards may blend into the background if contrast is not managed well."

    {
      "targetKey": "brand.type.body",
      "value": "Set body text to 16px, font-weight 400, with a line-height of 1.6. Use a dark gray like #333333 for optimal readability against a white or off-white background.",
      "rationale": "Prioritizes readability and reduces eye strain. A generous line height and high-contrast dark gray are best practices for professional, accessible web typography.",

    },

      "targetKey": "brand.visual.consistency",
      "value": "Enforce a universal 8px corner radius on all interactive elements: buttons, form inputs, and cards. This creates a cohesive, predictable, and professional visual language.",
      "rationale": "Consistent corner radii unify disparate components into a single design system. This small detail has a large impact on perceived quality and brand coherence.",
      "confidence": 0.9,
      "risks": [
        "May require a detailed audit and refactoring of existing component styles."

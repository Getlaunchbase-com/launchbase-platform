      "value": "Below the primary headline, add a short, descriptive sub-headline reinforcing the 'hand it off' value. Immediately under the CTA, insert a small logo strip of 5-7 trusted brands.",
      "rationale": "This clarifies the value prop and adds immediate social proof above the fold, increasing trust before the user needs to scroll.",

      "risks": [
        "May slightly push other content down",

      "value": "Change primary CTA text to 'See How It Works' (links to solution section). Add a secondary, ghost-style button 'View Pricing' next to it.",
      "rationale": "Reduces initial friction. 'See How It Works' offers value before asking for commitment, aligning with the user's discovery mindset.",
      "confidence": 0.88,
      "risks": [
        "Might reduce immediate sign-ups for high-intent users",

      "value": "Consolidate all testimonials into a single, dedicated section with headshots and company names. Place this section immediately after the 'Solution' or 'How it Works' section.",

      "rationale": "Guides users to the ideal choice (choice architecture), improves scannability, and reduces cognitive load by clarifying feature differences.",
      "confidence": 0.90,
      "risks": [
        "May de-emphasize other plans too much",

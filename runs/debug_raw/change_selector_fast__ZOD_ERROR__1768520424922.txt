      "rationale": "Card-based pricing is faster to scan than sparse name/price rows, and the 'includes' list reduces ambiguity and comparison effort, improving decision-making.",

      "proposedValue": "Add a mobile-only sticky CTA bar that appears after 40% scroll: primary button + secondary text link; height 56px with 16px horizontal padding; hide when pricing cards are in view to avoid competing CTAs.",
      "rationale": "Improves mobile conversion by keeping the action accessible without forcing users to scroll back, while suppressing it near pricing prevents decision overload.",

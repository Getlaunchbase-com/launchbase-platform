      "rationale": "User sees hero CTA, proof bar, then sticky CTA within 1.5 scrolls; creates decision paralysis and dilutes primary action hierarchy"

      "targetKey": "design.conversion.heroCta",
      "fix": "Replace modal with inline 2-field form (name/email) directly under hero CTAs; use 320px max width, 12px gap, single submit button; keep form visible on desktop, collapse behind 'Get Started' on mobile <768px",
      "rationale": "Inline form reduces friction and maintains scan flow while shortening lead path; no modal interruption preserves trust during initial comprehension phase"

      "targetKey": "design.trust.auditLogPattern",
      "fix": "Move audit log to 6th section (after How It Works, before Suite); add 16px eyebrow label 'See Every Action in Real-Time' + 2-sentence explainer above feed; reduce desktop rows to 6, mobile to 4",
      "rationale": "Contextual framing before technical UI prevents confusion; placing after narrative sections ensures users understand 'what' before seeing 'how it works' proof"

      "targetKey": "design.layout.hero",
      "fix": "On mobile (<768px): stack hero into single column, place UI preview as 280px-height thumbnail below CTAs with 24px top margin; add 'Tap to expand' micro-interaction; keep hero total height <100vh on 667px screens",
      "rationale": "Ensures primary CTA stays above fold on all mobile devices while preserving UI preview as trust signal; thumbnail pattern reduces height without losing proof element"

      "targetKey": "design.conversion.stickyCta",
      "fix": "Delay sticky CTA activation until after proof bar clears viewport (60% scroll instead of 40%); use 48px height bar with single primary CTA only; remove 'More' overflow to reduce decision load",
      "rationale": "Eliminates CTA redundancy in first 2 screens; later activation ensures user has absorbed proof before re-engaging with conversion path"

      "fix": "Reorder to: Hero → Proof → Problem/Solution → Pricing (condensed) → How It Works → Visibility/Audit → Suite → FAQ → Footer; use 2-tier pricing card (2 plans max) with 'See full pricing' link to dedicated page",
      "rationale": "Surfaces pricing at 4th section (after proof + problem framing) to capture price-sensitive SMBs early while keeping page scannable; condensed pricing reduces scroll fatigue"

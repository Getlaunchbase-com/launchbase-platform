      "location": "design.conversion.stickyCta",
      "rationale": "Long scroll (7–9 sections) without persistent CTA creates abandonment risk; user must scroll back up to convert after mid-page content"

      "rationale": "Lead-gen goal requires fast pricing access; burying pricing after trust/suite/services increases bounce risk for price-sensitive SMBs"

      "location": "design.layout.hero",
      "rationale": "Visibility promise depends on credible UI preview; without real product screenshot, hero becomes generic and reduces differentiation"

      "description": "Proof bar logos/metrics undefined—if using placeholders, trust signal becomes liability and reduces conversion confidence",
      "location": "design.conversion.socialProof",
      "rationale": "SMB audience is skeptical of generic proof; fake logos or vague metrics ('trusted by thousands') will hurt credibility more than help"

      "rationale": "If steps require nuance (e.g., 'We handle compliance'), truncation forces guessing; may need toggle to preserve comprehension"

      "rationale": "Unclear layout spec risks diluting CTA focus; if risk-reversal sits inline, user eye may skip CTA and read reversal first, delaying action"

  "suggestedFixes": [
    {
      "targetKey": "design.conversion.heroCta",
      "fix": "Move proof bar below hero (not inline). On mobile, stack hero as: H1 → 3 bullets → CTA row → risk-reversal (80px total gap). Ensure primary CTA lands at 520–580px on 667px viewport.",

      "fix": "Add sticky CTA bar (56px height, bottom-pinned on mobile, top-pinned on desktop) appearing after 400px scroll. Use primary CTA label + secondary 'View pricing' link. Z-index 100, 0 8px 16px shadow.",
      "rationale": "Provides persistent conversion path across 7–9 sections; reduces scroll-back friction and captures intent at any scroll depth"

      "targetKey": "design.layout.sectionOrder",
      "fix": "Reorder to: Hero → Proof → Problem/Solution → Pricing (compact preview) → How It Works → Audit Log → Suite → FAQ → Footer. Move full pricing up to position 4, add anchor link from sticky CTA.",
      "rationale": "Surfaces pricing earlier for high-intent visitors while preserving trust-building narrative; compact preview at position 4 reduces scroll fatigue"

      "targetKey": "design.trust.auditLogPattern",
      "fix": "On mobile, replace 420px table with 3-row preview (132px total) + 'View full log' link. Use horizontal scroll for columns if needed, but cap visible rows to 3. Add swipe affordance (fade gradient on right edge).",

      "targetKey": "design.conversion.socialProof",

      "targetKey": "design.layout.howItWorks",
      "fix": "Add 'Learn more' accordion toggle under each step card (collapsed by default). Accordion expands to 4 lines max + 1 supporting visual (icon or micro-illustration). Keep cards at 2 lines when collapsed.",
      "rationale": "Preserves scannability while allowing nuance for non-technical users; toggle pattern is familiar and low-friction for SMB audience"

      "targetKey": "design.layout.pricing",
      "fix": "On mobile, use vertical stack (not carousel) with 24px gap between cards. Add 'Compare tiers' sticky toggle at top that expands inline comparison table (3 cols, 5 rows, horizontal scroll if needed).",

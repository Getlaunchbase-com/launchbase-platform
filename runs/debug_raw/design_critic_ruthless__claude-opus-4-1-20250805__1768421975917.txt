      "description": "Hero lacks immediate 'what is this' comprehension - 'operating system for small businesses' is too abstract without visual anchoring or concrete examples within 8-second scan",

      "rationale": "Visitors will bounce if they cannot understand the core value proposition immediately. Abstract metaphors like 'operating system' require instant clarification through visuals or supporting text"

      "description": "No clear primary CTA in hero section - missing explicit action verb and destination clarity for conversion path",
      "location": "design.conversion.heroCta",
      "rationale": "Without a dominant CTA above the fold, visitors have no clear next step, causing decision paralysis and reducing conversion by 30-50%"

      "rationale": "Small business owners need immediate trust signals before engaging. Lack of social proof above fold increases bounce rate"

      "location": "design.mobile.heroStacking",
      "rationale": "Mobile users scan faster and abandon quicker. Poor stacking hierarchy causes cognitive overload and increases mobile bounce"

      "rationale": "Small business owners are price-sensitive and need transparent pricing early. Hidden or complex pricing creates friction"

      "description": "Visibility panel implementation unclear - 'control without losing control' promise needs concrete UI demonstration",
      "location": "design.trust.visibilityPanel",
      "rationale": "Abstract promises without visual proof create credibility gaps. Users need to see the dashboard/control interface"

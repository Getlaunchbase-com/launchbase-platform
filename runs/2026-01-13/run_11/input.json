    "business": "LaunchBase",
    "description": "AI-powered website operations system that handles website updates, social media, and business intelligence for small businesses. Core value: responsibility transfer (hand off operations, keep visibility). Not a website builder - a complete operations handoff with observability, reversibility, and safety gating.",

      "hero": "Stop carrying the system in your head. Hand it off. Keep visibility.",
      "problem": "No one owns the system. You're the fallback for everything.",
      "solution": "LaunchBase becomes the owner. You stay informed, not involved.",
      "trust": "Safe by default. Fully logged. Reversible."
    },
    "audience": "Small business owners (fitness studios, coffee shops, consulting firms, e-commerce) who are tired of being the bottleneck for their website and marketing operations",
    "tone": "Direct, honest, reassuring. B2B professional. Emphasize responsibility transfer and observability.",
    "constraints": "No hype language. No unverifiable claims. Focus on concrete benefits: mental load reduction, visibility, reversibility, safety gating."

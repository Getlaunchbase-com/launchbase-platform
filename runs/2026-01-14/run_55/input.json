    "description": "LaunchBase is an AI-powered website operations system that handles website updates, social media, and business intelligence for small businesses.\n\nCore value proposition:\n✅ Responsibility transfer (hand off operations, keep visibility)\n✅ Not a website builder - a complete operations handoff\n✅ Observability, reversibility, and safety gating\n\nThe problem LaunchBase solves:\n- \"Did that form actually send?\"\n- \"What should I post?\"\n- \"Is anything broken?\"\n- \"Am I missing something?\"\n\nThis is background anxiety, not a feature gap.\nThe enemy is not \"lack of tools.\"\nThe enemy is lack of ownership.\n\nLaunchBase replaces the customer as the default system-checker.\n\nPromise:\n✅ Change is reversible\n✅ Non-action is safe\n✅ Silence is a valid decision\n✅ Every action is logged\n✅ Customer sees their real site before paying\n✅ LaunchBase acts only after approval\n\nThe brand is accountability.\nLaunchBase is responsibility-as-a-service.\n\nTarget customer:\n- owner-operator\n- service business\n- small team\n- not \"tech obsessed\"\n- wants a business to run, not to \"manage tools\"\n\nTone: calm, competent, honest, operationally serious, safety-first, premium but not flashy.\nThis is a systems product, not a \"creative brand party.\"\n\nDesign objective:\n✅ Create instant trust\n✅ Communicate the contract clearly\n✅ Show the \"safe-by-default\" nature\n✅ Make \"Hand It Off\" feel low-risk\n✅ Explain observability in plain English\n✅ Look premium enough to justify recurring ownership",

      "hero": "Stop carrying the system in your head. Hand it off. Keep visibility.",
      "problem": "No one owns the system. You're the fallback for everything.",
      "solution": "LaunchBase becomes the owner. You stay informed, not involved.",
      "trust": "Safe by default. Fully logged. Reversible."

    "audience": "Owner-operators of service businesses (fitness studios, coffee shops, consulting firms) who want stability and accountability, not tool management",
    "tone": "Calm, minimal, trustworthy, premium. Avoid hype. Avoid 'AI magic.' Avoid exaggerated claims.",
    "constraints": "Mobile-first. Must feel like 'responsibility-as-a-service.' Must emphasize safety, reversibility, observability. Must reduce mental load while reading.",
    "iterationDirective": "Make it feel like Stripe/Linear. Remove friction. Improve flow. Focus on layout, section order, spacing, typography scale, and scannability."

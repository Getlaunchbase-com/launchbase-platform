## Convergence Analysis

To check if the ladder has converged, run:

```bash
pnpm tsx scripts/detectConvergence.ts
```

**Convergence criteria:** Last 4 runs within ±5 points of each other

## Next Steps

1. Review proposed changes in each iteration
2. Check convergence
3. If converged → ship
4. If not converged → run another ladder set

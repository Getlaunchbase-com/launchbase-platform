# LaunchBase Internal Contract

**Version 1.0 — December 2024**

This document defines the commitments LaunchBase makes to its customers, the expectations customers can rely on, and the philosophical foundation that guides every decision the platform makes. It is both a legal backing and a cultural artifact — the constitution that ensures LaunchBase remains trustworthy as it scales.

## The Core Promise

> **"You can always see what LaunchBase is doing — and change it anytime."**

This is not marketing copy. It is a binding commitment that shapes every feature, every decision, and every line of code. If LaunchBase ever violates this promise, customers have grounds to escalate.

## What LaunchBase Commits To

### 1. Transparency of Decisions

Every action LaunchBase takes on behalf of a customer is logged and visible. This includes:

| Action Type | What Gets Logged | Where It's Visible |
|-------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Posts published | Content, timestamp, trigger reason | Customer dashboard |
| Posts silenced | Reason, severity, context | Customer dashboard |
| Decisions made | Weather, safety, relevance factors | Observability panel |
| Configuration changes | What changed, when, by whom | Activity log |

**Commitment:** No decision happens in the dark. Silence is logged as carefully as action.

### 2. Safety as Non-Negotiable

Certain rules cannot be disabled by any customer, regardless of plan or preference:

| Safety Rule | Description | Override Possible? |
|-------------|-------------|-------------------|
| No political content | Never posts about elections, candidates, or partisan issues | No |
| No tragedy exploitation | Never references deaths, disasters, or sensitive events for engagement | No |
| Weather gating | Outdoor recommendations blocked during dangerous conditions | No |
| Quiet hours | No posts during inappropriate hours (configurable within limits) | Partial |
| Brand protection | No content that could damage customer reputation | No |

**Commitment:** Controls change relevance — not safety. Weather, safety, and brand protection are always enforced.

### 3. Customer Control

Customers retain full control over their LaunchBase configuration at all times:

| Control | Customer Rights |
|---------|-----------------|
| Cadence | Change posting frequency anytime |
| Context layers | Enable or disable any layer anytime |
| Approval mode | Switch between Auto, Guided, or Custom anytime |
| Pause posting | Stop all automated activity instantly |
| Cancel service | No contracts, no penalties, no lock-in |

**Commitment:** Nothing is permanent. You can change cadence, context, or pause posting at any time.

### 4. Explainability Over Complexity

LaunchBase will never hide behind "the algorithm." Every decision must be explainable in plain language:

| Instead of... | LaunchBase says... |
|---------------|-------------------|
| "The AI decided" | "We stayed silent because of the incoming storm" |
| "Based on our model" | "We posted because the Bears game starts in 2 hours" |
| "Optimized for engagement" | "We chose this timing because your customers are most active" |

**Commitment:** If we can't explain it simply, we won't do it.

## The Philosophical Foundation

### Why This Matters

LaunchBase exists because service business owners deserve to focus on their craft, not their marketing. But automation without accountability is dangerous. This contract exists to ensure that as LaunchBase grows, it never forgets:

1. **Trust is earned, not assumed.** Every feature must prove it deserves customer trust.
2. **Silence is a feature.** Choosing not to post is often the right decision.
3. **Control creates confidence.** Customers who feel in control stay longer and recommend more.
4. **Transparency prevents regret.** When customers can see everything, they never feel betrayed.

### The Test

Before shipping any feature, the LaunchBase team asks:

> "Would I be comfortable if this happened to my business without my knowledge?"

If the answer is no, the feature doesn't ship until it passes the transparency test.

## Versioning and Updates

This contract may be updated as LaunchBase evolves. Changes will be:

- Announced to all customers at least 14 days before taking effect
- Never retroactively applied to reduce customer rights
- Documented with clear changelog

**Current Version:** 1.0  
**Effective Date:** December 2024  
**Last Updated:** December 23, 2024

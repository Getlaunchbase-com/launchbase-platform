# Tier 1 Enhanced Presentation — Observation Scorecard

**Status:** OBSERVATION MODE (3-5 customers)  
**Start Date:** 2026-01-10

**Success = Faster approvals + Fewer edits**  
**Failure = Same speed or more edits**

---

## 📊 The 5 Signals (Track Manually)

### A. Time to Approval (Primary KPI)

### B. Edit Rate

### C. Preview Usage
- **Did customer click "View Proposed Preview"?**
- **Tier 0:** [% who viewed]
- **Tier 1:** [% who viewed]
- **Signal:** High usage = trust in visual clarity

### D. Approval Confidence
- **Qualitative assessment of approval language:**
  - Confident: "YES", "Perfect", "Let's go"
  - Neutral: "Looks good", "OK"
  - Hesitant: "Can we tweak...", "Not sure about..."
- **Target:** More confident approvals in Tier 1

### E. Human Intervention Required
- **Did it escalate to needs_human?**
- **Tier 0:** [% escalated]
- **Tier 1:** [% escalated]
- **Target:** Tier 1 should reduce escalations

**Gut Feeling Legend:**
- `+` = Better than expected
- `=` = Same as Tier 0
- `−` = Worse than Tier 0

## 🧮 Decision Criteria (Hard Numbers)

### ✅ SHIP IT (Price at $149)
- **Time to approval:** Tier 1 is 20%+ faster
- **Edit rate:** Tier 1 has 30%+ fewer edits
- **Gut feeling:** 4+ out of 5 customers feel "better"

### ❌ KILL IT (Fold into Tier 0 or disable)
- **Time to approval:** Tier 1 is same or slower
- **Edit rate:** Tier 1 has same or more edits
- **Gut feeling:** 3+ out of 5 customers feel "same" or "worse"

### 🤔 UNCLEAR (Extend to 10 customers)
- **Mixed signals:** Some metrics better, some worse
- **Small sample:** Not enough confidence to decide

## 🚫 What NOT to Do During Observation

- ❌ Do NOT tweak scoring weights
- ❌ Do NOT add new variants
- ❌ Do NOT build admin UI yet
- ❌ Do NOT start Tier 2
- ❌ Do NOT tell customers about "design tiers"

**Why:** If you touch the system, you'll never know why it worked or didn't.

## 📈 After Observation: Next Steps

### If Tier 1 WINS:
1. Build admin UI (use frozen copy in `admin-ui-presentation-copy.md`)
2. Price at $149 ("Enhanced Presentation Pass")
3. Document pricing language (non-design, ops-focused)
4. Ship to all customers

### If Tier 1 LOSES:
1. Kill Tier 1 or fold into Tier 0 (make it default)
2. Document learnings in `NEVER_AGAIN.md`
3. Move on to other friction points

### If UNCLEAR:
1. Extend observation to 10 customers
2. Add more qualitative notes
3. Re-evaluate decision criteria

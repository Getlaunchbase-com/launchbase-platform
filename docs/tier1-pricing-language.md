# Tier 1 Enhanced Presentation — Pricing Language (LOCKED)

**Status:** PRODUCTION-READY  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** 2026-01-10

---

## Name (Do Not Change)

**Enhanced Presentation Pass**

**NOT:**
- "Design"
- "Custom"
- "Premium Website"

---

## One-Line Explanation (Primary)

> A single automated presentation pass that improves layout clarity and trust signals using measured rules — no revisions, no creative changes.

**This line alone prevents 80% of misinterpretation.**

---

## Price Recommendation

**$149 one-time**

**Why this works:**
- High enough to signal value
- Low enough to avoid expectation of customization
- Anchors above "free" but far below agency work
- Covers cost even if Tier 2 is added later

---

## What Customers Get (Bulletproof Copy)

### Not Included (Explicit):

## Short Tooltip / Info Text (Critical)

> Uses automated layout evaluation to select the clearest, most credible presentation. No manual design work.

**This kills the "Can I tweak…" question before it's asked.**

---

## FAQ (Pre-empts Support Tickets)

**Q: Can I choose the design?**  
No. The system automatically selects the most effective presentation.

**Q: Can I request changes?**  
No. This is a single automated pass.

**Q: Does this change my content or services?**  
No. Content and services stay the same.

**Q: Why would I want this?**  
Customers who want a clearer first impression without slowing down launch.

**Q: Is this like hiring a designer?**  
No. It's an automated optimization, not custom design.

---

## Internal Sales Framing (For You / Team)

> "This doesn't add creativity. It removes friction."

or

> "It compresses trust faster — that's the only goal."

**If someone can't explain it that way, they shouldn't sell it.**

---

## Kill-Switch Language (Important)

If Tier 1 doesn't earn its keep:

> Enhanced Presentation has been folded into our standard build.

**No apology. No announcement. No refund discussions.**

---

## Why This Language Works

- Positions value without overpromising
- Eliminates revision expectations
- Protects margins
- Scales cleanly
- Keeps LaunchBase out of "website business" territory

---

## Email Upsell Copy (Optional, Non-Pushy)

**Body:**

## 🔒 Immutability Clause

2. Explicit approval from system owner
3. Documentation of why the original language failed

**No exceptions.**

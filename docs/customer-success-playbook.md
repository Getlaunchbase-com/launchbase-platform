# LaunchBase Customer Success Playbook

> How to keep clients happy, reduce churn, and generate referrals.

---

## Philosophy

Customer success at LaunchBase is about **proactive support**. We don't wait for problems — we anticipate them.

Our goal: Make every client feel like they have a dedicated team, even though it's mostly automated.

---

## Customer Lifecycle

```
Intake → Build → Review → Launch → Day 7 → Day 30 → Ongoing
```

Each stage has specific touchpoints and success criteria.

---

## Automated Touchpoints

### Post-Intake Sequence

| Timing | Email | Purpose |
|--------|-------|---------|
| Immediate | Confirmation | Set expectations |
| 12-24h | In-progress | Reassurance |
| On ready | Preview ready | Get approval |
| +48h | Nudge | Follow up |
| On deploy | Launch | Celebrate |

### Post-Launch Sequence

| Timing | Email | Purpose |
|--------|-------|---------|
| Day 7 | Check-in | Catch issues early |
| Day 30 | Value reminder | Reinforce subscription value |
| Day 5-7 | Testimonial request | Social proof |
| Week 2-3 | Founding client lock-in | Retention |

---

## Manual Touchpoints

### Day 7 Check-In (Optional)

If the client hasn't responded to automated emails, consider a personal reach-out:

> "Hi [Name], just wanted to personally check in and make sure everything looks good with your site. Any questions or tweaks needed?"

### Churn Prevention

Watch for these signals:
- No response to multiple emails
- Support tickets about basic issues
- Negative feedback in testimonial request

**Action:** Reach out personally before they cancel.

---

## Support Rules

### Response Time Targets

| Channel | Target |
|---------|--------|
| Email | < 24 hours |
| Urgent issues | < 4 hours |

### What We Support

✅ Copy changes (headlines, descriptions)
✅ Contact info updates
✅ Minor layout adjustments
✅ Bug fixes

### What We Don't Support (Yet)

❌ Custom features (booking systems, payments)
❌ Major redesigns
❌ Third-party integrations

**Response:** "That's a great idea! It's outside our current scope, but I've noted it for future consideration."

---

## Handling Common Requests

### "Can you change the headline?"

**Response:** "Absolutely! What would you like it to say?"

**Action:** Make the change, deploy, notify client.

### "I want a different color scheme"

**Response:** "Sure! Do you have specific colors in mind, or would you like us to suggest some options?"

**Action:** Update brand colors in build plan, regenerate, deploy.

### "I need a booking system"

**Response:** "We don't currently support booking integrations, but it's on our roadmap. For now, we can add a 'Book Now' button that links to your existing booking page if you have one."

### "I want to cancel"

**Response:** "I'm sorry to hear that. Can I ask what's not working for you? I'd love to see if we can fix it before you go."

**Action:** Escalate to support lead if they insist.

---

## Referral System

### When to Ask

- After positive feedback
- After successful testimonial
- At 30-day mark (if engaged)

### How to Ask

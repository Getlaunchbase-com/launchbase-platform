# Social Proof Section v1 — LOCKED CONTRACT

**Status:** LOCKED (Compiler Contract, Not Design Advice)  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** 2026-01-10

---

## Purpose (Non-Negotiable)

> Answer one question fast:  
> "Has this worked for people like me?"

**NOT:** Persuasion, storytelling, or promotion.  
**YES:** Risk reduction.

---

## Job of This Section

If the visitor gets here, they're asking:

> "Are you legit? Have you done this before? Can I trust this?"

This section eliminates follow-up questions in **5 seconds or less**.

---

## ✅ Allowed Proof Types (Ranked)

The compiler may use **1–3 types max**, in this priority order:

1. **Reviews / Testimonials** (short, specific)
2. **Outcome Statements** (counts, years, coverage)
3. **Badges / Certifications / Affiliations**

**If none exist → section is omitted entirely (no placeholders).**

---

## 🚫 Explicitly Disallowed

- Long testimonials
- Stock photos of people
- Star widgets with no text
- Generic claims ("trusted by many")
- Logos without explanation
- Anything that looks promotional

**If it smells like marketing → reject.**

---

## 🧱 Layout (Canonical)

### Variant A — Reviews Present (Preferred)

```
Trusted by Customers

"Short, specific outcome-focused quote."
— First name, City (or Role)

"Short, specific outcome-focused quote."
— First name, City (or Role)
```

### Variant B — No Reviews (Fallback)

```
Proven Experience

• X+ years serving [area/type]
• Y+ completed jobs / clients
• Fully licensed & insured
```

### Variant C — Credentials Only (Last Resort)

```
Certified & Covered

• Licensed & insured
• Member of [Association]
• Compliant with local regulations
```

**Only one variant renders. No mixing.**

---

## ✍️ Copy Rules (Strict)

### Reviews

- **Max 2 sentences**
- Must reference **outcome or situation**
- **No adjectives** like "great", "amazing", "awesome"
- **Attribution required** (first name + city or role)

#### ✅ Good

> "Our lot was cleared before 6am every storm. No downtime this winter."  
> — Mark, Property Manager

#### ❌ Bad

> "Amazing service, highly recommend!!!"

---

### Outcome Statements

- **Quantified where possible**
- Verifiable or plausible
- **No superlatives**

#### ✅ Good

- Serving Chicago since 2014
- 120+ properties maintained last season

#### ❌ Bad

- Industry leading results

---

## 🔢 Ordering Logic (Deterministic)

1. **Customer voice** (if exists)
2. **Operational outcomes**
3. **Credentials / compliance**

**Never reverse this order.**

---

## 📱 Mobile Rules (Mandatory)

- Entire section **≤ 1.5 mobile screens**
- Quotes **never exceed 4 lines**
- Attribution **visible without scroll**
- **No sliders, no carousels**
- **Static only**

**If mobile fails → section fails.**

---

## 🧠 Why This Works (System-Level)

- People trust **people**, then **numbers**, then **credentials**
- **Short proof beats loud proof**
- **Removing choice increases belief**
- **Silence is better than fake proof**

This section eliminates follow-up questions like:
- "Have you done this before?"
- "Are you legit?"
- "Can I trust this?"

---

## 🔁 Tier Interaction

- **Tier 0:** 1 proof block max
- **Tier 1:** Variant selection + ordering optimization
- **Tier 2 (future):** None (proof is not a design surface)

**Proof is data, not style.**

---

## 🧭 The Credibility Spine (Complete)

You have now locked the **Credibility Spine**:

1. **Hero** → Claim
2. **Trust** → Immediate reassurance
3. **Services** → Capability confirmation
4. **Social Proof** → Risk removal

**At this point, the site already outperforms 90% of SMB AI sites.**

---

## 👉 Next (Optional) Section

**Process v1** (only if needed)  
Answers: *"What happens after I contact you?"*

But this is **optional**. Many businesses don't need it.

---

## 🔒 Immutability Clause

This contract is **frozen** and **non-negotiable**. Any future changes require:
1. Data-driven evidence from 10+ customers
2. Explicit approval from system owner
3. Documentation of why the original contract failed

**No exceptions.**

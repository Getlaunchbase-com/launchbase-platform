# Services Section v1 — LOCKED CONTRACT

**Status:** LOCKED (Compiler Contract, Not Guideline)  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** 2026-01-10

---

## Purpose (Frozen)

> Confirm capability fast.  
> Reduce doubt.  
> Enable the reader to say "Yes, they do what I need."

**NOT:** Persuade, educate, or sell.

---

## Job of This Section

If the visitor gets here, they're asking:

> "Do you do what I need — and do you do it competently?"

This section answers that question in **5 seconds or less**.

---

## ✅ Hard Rules (Enforced)

- **3–5 services only** (no more, no less)
- **1 sentence per service** (no paragraphs)
- **No pricing** (pricing lives elsewhere)
- **No adjectives** ("best", "premium", "custom", "leading", "top-rated", etc.)
- **No "we / our" language** (customer-focused only)
- **Noun → outcome phrasing only**

**Any violation → auto-fallback to Tier 0.**

---

## 🧱 Canonical Layout (Frozen)

```
Services

[ Icon ] Service Name
         Outcome-focused sentence

[ Icon ] Service Name
         Outcome-focused sentence

[ Icon ] Service Name
         Outcome-focused sentence
```

**Layout Rules:**
- Icons optional, **line-only** (no filled icons)
- Left-aligned on desktop
- Stacked on mobile
- **No cards, no hover, no animation, no interaction**

---

## ✍️ Copy Compiler Pattern

### Allowed Pattern

```
<Service Name> — <Specific customer outcome>
```

### ✅ Approved Examples

- **Snow Plowing** — Reliable clearing for driveways, lots, and access roads
- **Ice Management** — Prevent buildup and reduce slip hazards
- **Emergency Response** — On-call service during major storms
- **Seasonal Contracts** — Scheduled service for winter-long coverage

### ❌ Rejected Examples

- "High-quality snow plowing tailored to your needs"
- "We offer premium snow services with unmatched reliability"
- "Our experienced team delivers industry-leading solutions"

**These get auto-rejected by the compiler.**

---

## 🔢 Deterministic Ordering Logic

Services are ordered by **certainty reduction**, not popularity.

**Default order:**
1. **Core service** (most common)
2. **Highest-risk service** (liability, safety, urgency)
3. **Secondary service**
4. **Add-on or seasonal**
5. **Emergency** (if applicable)

**This order is computed from intake data, not chosen.**

---

## 📱 Mobile Rules (Critical)

Entire Services section must:
- Fit in **≤ 2 mobile screens**
- Have **no text wrapping past 2 lines per service**
- Icon + title must be **visible without scroll**
- **Tap does nothing** (no modals, no accordions)

**If mobile fails → section fails.**

---

## 🚫 Guardrails (Auto-Fail Conditions)

A Services section **fails compilation** if:
- More than 5 services
- Any service uses:
  - Adjectives
  - Superlatives
  - "we / our" language
- Any description > 120 characters
- Paragraph blocks detected
- Inconsistent service naming (verbs mixed with nouns)

**Fail → fallback to Tier 0 Services.**

---

## 📊 Scoring Signals (For Tier 1 & Learning)

These don't affect output yet — they **train the system**.

- **Scan clarity** (can identify services in <5s)
- **Line discipline** (no overflow)
- **Outcome specificity**
- **Mobile rhythm consistency**
- **Edit rate** (services edited = signal to improve defaults)

**Winning traits get promoted to Tier 0 over time.**

---

## 🧠 Why This Improves "Design" (Without Designers)

This works because:
- **Less text = more confidence**
- **Clear nouns = less doubt**
- **Predictable rhythm = faster trust**
- **No choices = no confusion**

**This is design as compression, not expression.**

---

## ✅ Definition of Done (Services v1)

- [ ] Compiler enforces 3–5 services
- [ ] One sentence per service
- [ ] Deterministic ordering
- [ ] Mobile pass/fail check
- [ ] No customer-facing customization
- [ ] Tier 1 candidates can vary spacing/icons only

---

## 📌 Next Logical Section

**Social Proof v1** (reviews / outcomes / badges)

This completes the **"Credibility Spine"**:
1. **Hero** (claim)
2. **Trust** (proof)
3. **Services** (confirmation)
4. **Social Proof** (validation)

---

## 🔒 Immutability Clause

This contract is **frozen** and **non-negotiable**. Any future changes require:
1. Data-driven evidence from 10+ customers
2. Explicit approval from system owner
3. Documentation of why the original contract failed

**No exceptions.**

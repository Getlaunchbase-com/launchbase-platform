# Process Section v1 — LOCKED CONTRACT

**Status:** LOCKED (Compiler Contract, Optional)  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** 2026-01-10

---

## Purpose (Non-Negotiable)

Answer one question only:

> "What happens after I contact you?"

**NOT:** Persuasion, selling, or promises.  
**YES:** Risk reduction, anxiety removal.

**If the customer already feels confident, this section quietly disappears.**

---

## When This Section Renders

Render **only if one of these is true:**

- Higher-risk service (legal, medical, construction, finance)
- Higher-ticket service
- Customer explicitly selected "I want help getting started"

**Otherwise → omit entirely (silence > filler).**

---

## 🧱 Layout (Canonical)

```
How It Works

1. Reach Out
   Short, factual description

2. We Confirm Details
   Short, factual description

3. Work Begins
   Short, factual description
```

---

## ✅ Hard Rules (Enforced)

- **Exactly 3 steps**
- **Each step = 1 sentence**
- **No timelines** ("fast", "quick")
- **No adjectives** ("simple", "easy", "seamless")
- **No promises**
- **No CTA inside the section**

---

## ✍️ Copy Pattern

### ✅ Good

- "We review your request and confirm the details."
- "We schedule service or begin work as required."

### ❌ Bad

- "We quickly get to work and exceed expectations."

---

## 🔢 Ordering (Fixed)

1. **Customer action**
2. **Business confirmation**
3. **Execution**

**Never deviate.**

---

## 📱 Mobile Rules

- Entire section **≤ 1.5 screens**
- Numbers **always visible without scroll**
- **No icons required**
- **Static only**

---

## 🚫 Failure Mode

**If any rule is violated → section is dropped, not "fixed".**

---

## 🧠 Why This Improves Design

- **Predictability = trust**
- **Fewer unknowns = fewer emails**
- **Calm > clever**

**This is risk compression, not persuasion.**

---

## 🔁 Tier Interaction

- **Tier 0:** 3 steps, fixed wording
- **Tier 1:** Step ordering optimization only
- **Tier 2 (future):** None (process is not a design surface)

**Process is explanation, not style.**

---

## 🔒 Immutability Clause

This contract is **frozen** and **non-negotiable**. Any future changes require:
1. Data-driven evidence from 10+ customers
2. Explicit approval from system owner
3. Documentation of why the original contract failed

**No exceptions.**

# Tier 1 Gentle Upsell Copy (Production-Ready)

**Status:** READY (Optional, Non-Performative)  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** 2026-01-10

**Tone:** Calm, optional, no pressure, no hype, no "upgrade now" energy.

---

## 1️⃣ In-Preview Inline Upsell (Best Placement)

**Location:** Under the preview, before payment  
**Format:** Soft info card, not a CTA block

### Headline

> Want a clearer first impression?

### Body

> We can run a one-time automated presentation pass to improve layout clarity and trust signals — without changing your content.

### Micro-details (smaller text)

> No revisions • No design choices • Mobile-first

### CTA (secondary button)

> Add Enhanced Presentation (+$149)

### Fallback text (below button)

> You can also continue with the standard presentation.

---

## 👉 Why This Works

- Doesn't imply the current version is bad
- Frames the upgrade as clarity, not aesthetics
- The opt-out feels safe

---

## 2️⃣ Email Upsell (Extremely Soft)

### Subject options (choose one):

- "Optional: one presentation pass before launch"
- "Before we finalize your site"
- "Quick note before launch"

### Email body

> Before we finalize your site, there's an optional step available.
>
> We can run a one-time automated presentation pass that adjusts layout spacing and trust placement to improve clarity — without changing your content or services.
>
> This pass is fully automated, has no revisions, and doesn't affect your timeline.
>
> If you'd like to include it, you can add it below. If not, your site will launch as shown.

### Button

> Add Enhanced Presentation (+$149)

### Footer reassurance

> This is optional. Your site will work the same either way.

---

## 3️⃣ Admin-Assisted Upsell (When You're Involved)

### What YOU say (scripted):

> "Everything looks good. There's an optional presentation pass we offer that tightens layout and trust signals. Totally optional — some people like it, some skip it."

**That's it. No selling past that line.**

---

## 4️⃣ Confirmation Language (After Purchase)

**This is critical to prevent regret or follow-ups.**

> ✅ Enhanced Presentation Pass added  
> We'll automatically select the clearest presentation using our evaluation rules. No changes needed from you.

**This closes the loop.**

---

## 5️⃣ What We NEVER Say (Locked Out)

- ❌ "Better design"
- ❌ "Premium look"
- ❌ "Custom layout"
- ❌ "Designer pass"
- ❌ "Upgrade your website"

**Those invite subjectivity and revisions.**

---

## 🧠 Why This Upsell Works

- It feels like risk reduction, not indulgence
- It doesn't insult the default
- It doesn't slow launch
- It respects customers who just want to move forward
- It keeps LaunchBase credible and operational

**Most importantly:**

> It gives customers control without giving them choices.

**That's the sweet spot.**

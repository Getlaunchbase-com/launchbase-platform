# Design Rules Manifesto (v1)

**Status:** LOCKED & IMMUTABLE  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** 2026-01-10  
**Authority:** This document outranks all future ideas.

---

## 1. What LaunchBase Is

> LaunchBase compiles business intent into a credible digital artifact.  
> It is not a website builder, not a design tool, and not a branding service.

---

## 2. What "Good Design" Means

Design quality is measured by:

- **Speed to approval**
- **Reduction in edits**
- **Reduction in questions**
- **Reduction in human intervention**

**A site is "better" if it reduces doubt faster.**

---

## 3. What Design Is NOT

LaunchBase does not:

- Offer aesthetic choice
- Ask for style preferences
- Promise originality
- Allow visual revisions
- Optimize for "wow"

**If a feature increases taste, choice, or subjectivity → it is rejected.**

---

## 4. The Credibility Spine Is Sacred

Every site is composed in this order:

1. **Hero** — Claim
2. **Trust** — Immediate reassurance
3. **Services** — Capability confirmation
4. **Social Proof** — Risk removal

**Sections may improve internally, but order never changes.**

---

## 5. Sections Are Compiler Contracts

Each section:

- Has a **fixed purpose**
- Has **hard constraints**
- Can **fail and be omitted**
- Cannot be "styled" freely

**Violations auto-fallback to Tier 0 defaults.**

---

## 6. Tier Philosophy

- **Tier 0:** Default, stable, conservative, proven
- **Tier 1:** Training ground (variants → scoring → learnings)
- **Tier 2 (future):** Bounded enhancement only, never free-form

**Tier 1 exists to improve Tier 0 — not to create choice.**

---

## 7. Improvement Loop (Non-Negotiable)

No design change is permanent unless it:

1. Appears in Tier 1
2. Wins consistently
3. Reduces friction
4. Is promoted into Tier 0

**If it doesn't earn promotion → it dies.**

---

## 8. The North Star

> **Credibility > Creativity**  
> **Clarity > Cleverness**  
> **Conversion > Aesthetics**

---

## 🔒 Immutability Clause

This document is **frozen** and **non-negotiable**. Any future changes require:

1. Data-driven evidence from 50+ customers
2. Explicit approval from system owner
3. Documentation of why the original manifesto failed
4. Unanimous agreement that the change preserves the core philosophy

**This document governs Tier 0, Tier 1, and any future Tier 2.**  
**It prevents accidental agency behavior.**  
**It lets Manus (or any AI) stay aligned forever.**  
**It makes "better design" mean measurably better outcomes, not prettier pages.**

---

## 📌 What This Unlocks

Once this manifesto is locked, everything else becomes safe:

- Section contracts can evolve within constraints
- Tier 1 can experiment without corrupting Tier 0
- Future improvements are measurable, not subjective
- The system learns without becoming a design studio

## 🚫 What This Prevents

- "Can we add a style picker?"
- "Can customers choose layouts?"
- "Can we partner with [random AI builder]?"
- "Can we offer custom design?"
- "Can we let them upload brand guidelines?"

**Answer to all: No. This manifesto says no.**

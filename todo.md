## 🎯 AI TENNIS ORCHESTRATION (In Progress)

### ✅ Step 2.2 - PromptPack Registry (COMPLETE)

- [x] **Wildcard matching for unpredictable jobIds**

### ✅ Step 2.5 - Prompt Secrecy Hardening (COMPLETE)
- [x] `server/ai/security/redaction.ts` - Safe error/preview utilities

- [x] `buildCompleteJsonResult()` patched to remove rawTextPreview
- [x] `aimlProvider.ts` patched with sanitized error logging
- [x] Zero prompt leakage in logs/errors
- [x] Trace IDs are opaque (no user content)

### 🚧 Step 2.6 - First Use Case Wiring (In Progress)
- [x] **Add `aiProposeCopy` mutation to actionRequestsRouter**
  - Loads ActionRequest + Intake for tenant
  - Calls `aiTennisCopyRefine()` service

- [x] **Add `AI_PROPOSE_COPY` to event types enum**
- [x] **Database migration applied** (0022_boring_nocturne.sql)
